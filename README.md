## New England States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM)
This was one piece of a freelance project that I completed for NESCAUM.  

#### It's made in React and has two components:

  * A portal for users to access information

  * An application that fetches data via an API and displays it to users with filtering, sorting, and searching functionality



#### Packages used include:

* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)

* [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

* [Node Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)
