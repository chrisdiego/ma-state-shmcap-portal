## New England States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM)
This was one piece of a freelance project that I completed for NESCAUM.  

It's made in React and has two components:
-A portal for users to access information
-An application that fetches data via an API and displays it to users with filtering, sorting, and searching functionality


Packages used include:
Material UI
Bootstrap 4
Create React App
React Router
Node Sass
