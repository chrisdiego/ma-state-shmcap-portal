                    <p>In the face of climate change, it is critical to build long-term resilience throughout Massachusetts by leveraging historical risk data and integrating that data with projected future climate conditions. The <b>2018 State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan (SHMCAP)</b> expands upon the previous planning efforts of the Commonwealthâ€™s 2013 State Hazard Mitigation Plan and the 2011 Massachusetts Climate Change Adaptation Report. It accounts for projected changes in precipitation, temperature, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events to position the Commonwealth to effectively reduce the risks associated with natural hazards and the effects of climate change.</p>
                    <p>This innovative plan encompasses the results of a multi-step planning process with a robust outreach and engagement program to incorporate diverse stakeholders across the Commonwealth in all phases of plan development, including identification of risks and vulnerabilities as well as goal setting and action development. The planning process was managed through a close partnership among the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EOEEA), the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS), and the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), and involved a Project Management Team composed of technical specialists from several key state agencies.</p>
